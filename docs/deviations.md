# Deviations from the implementation plan

Each entry records a place where the built thing differs from
`docs/research.md` and the Phases 0–3 plan, and why. Kept so a reader of the
plan is not surprised by the code, and so a deviation is a decision rather than
a drift.

## Dart SDK floor is 3.8, not 3.6

The plan sets Dart ≥ 3.6 and separately pins `json_serializable` 6.14.1. Those
are inconsistent: 6.14.1 requires SDK `^3.8.0`. Taking the pinned dependency
versions, the package declares `sdk: ^3.8.0` and `doctor`'s Dart check uses the
same floor, in one place.

The alternative — an older `json_serializable` — would have meant unpinning a
version the plan states explicitly.

## The Gradle init script is Groovy, not Kotlin DSL

The plan names `tool/gradle/taxiway_dump.gradle.kts`. It is
`tool/gradle/taxiway_dump.gradle`, written in Groovy.

The script reads AGP's `android` extension **reflectively**, after the project
has been evaluated. Groovy's dynamic property access does this with no AGP types
on its own classpath, so one script works identically against a Kotlin-DSL or a
Groovy-DSL build. A Kotlin init script would need compile-time types it cannot
have — it would have to declare a dependency on AGP, pinned to a version, and
would then break on projects using a different one.

## `--deep` does not pass `--offline`

An early version did, reasoning that a read should not touch the network. That
was wrong: a Flutter Android build resolves the Kotlin and Flutter Gradle
plugins from the network, and `--offline` turns a working project into a failed
deep read for anyone without a fully warm cache. Verified against a real
project, where it failed to resolve `org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm`.

`--no-daemon` is still passed: a read must not leave a daemon running against a
project it only meant to look at.

## The dependency-direction test encodes a DAG, not a chain

The plan states the direction as
`cli → core → {inspect, generators} → platform → secrets`. Read literally as
"each layer may only import to its right", that is not satisfiable — every
reader needs `core`'s `ProcessRunner` and `ProjectModel`.

`test/unit/architecture/dependency_direction_test.dart` encodes the DAG the
arrow describes instead: `core` is the shared base that imports nothing
internal, `cli` is the outermost layer, and each layer in between names exactly
what it may import. The plan's one hard rule — nothing in `core` imports `cli` —
is asserted separately.

## Config fields added beyond the plan's schema

Four, each forced by a real project failing the import-fidelity gate. They are
documented with their reasons in [`config-schema.md`](config-schema.md).

## `doctor` gained a Gradle wrapper check

Not in the plan's check table. Added because a real project failed to build and
to deep-read for exactly this reason: its wrapper was Gradle 8.12 against
Flutter's 8.14 minimum. Flutter's own error names a Gradle version and nothing a
user would think to search for, and the same condition silently disables
`taxiway import --deep`.

The floor lives in `platform_deadlines.dart` with the other facts about the
world that go stale, so it carries a `lastVerified` date like the rest.

## No per-flavor `ios/Flutter/<flavor>.xcconfig` is generated

The plan's artifact inventory lists one, and taxiway wrote one and attached it
to each `<BuildType>-<flavor>` configuration as its base configuration. That is
wrong, and the way it is wrong is silent.

A build configuration has exactly one base configuration. Attaching taxiway's
displaces the stock `ios/Flutter/Debug.xcconfig` / `Release.xcconfig`, and those
are the files that `#include "Generated.xcconfig"` — the file `flutter build`
writes, carrying `FLUTTER_TARGET`, `DART_DEFINES`, `FLUTTER_BUILD_NAME` and
`FLUTTER_BUILD_NUMBER`. A flavored build therefore:

- compiled `lib/main.dart` no matter what `-t` said, so `main_<flavor>.dart` was
  generated and then ignored — the wrong app under the right bundle id;
- dropped every `--dart-define`;
- produced an `Info.plist` with **no** `CFBundleShortVersionString` and no
  `CFBundleVersion`, because Xcode drops a key whose value expands to empty.
  App Store Connect rejects that upload.

None of it is visible in a build log: `flutter build ipa` prints
`Version Number: Missing` in its App Settings Validation block and exits 0.

In a CocoaPods project the same displacement also drops the
`#include? "Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-Runner/Pods-Runner.<config>.xcconfig"`
line, along with anything the project itself keeps in those files.

So flavor configurations now inherit the base configuration of the build type
they derive from, which is what a hand-made flavor setup does — verified against
a real two-flavor project, where `Release-development` points at the stock
`Release.xcconfig` and every per-flavor value lives in the configuration's own
`buildSettings`. taxiway does the same: bundle id, `APP_DISPLAY_NAME` and
`DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` are written onto the configuration, which is also where they
have to be for a target's own settings to win.

The inherited reference is read from the project rather than assumed, so a
project that points `Profile` somewhere other than `Release.xcconfig` keeps
doing so.

Projects generated by the earlier behaviour are repaired in place: the bridge
re-asserts the inherited base configuration on every run, and
`LegacyXcconfigCleanup` deletes the orphaned `<flavor>.xcconfig` — but only when
taxiway wrote it and it is still byte-for-byte what taxiway wrote. One that has
been edited is left alone and reported, because deleting somebody's build
settings is worse than leaving a file nothing references.

## The error classifier is seeded from reproduced failures, not only the catalog

The plan supplies an error-classifier table. Roughly half of it is reproduced in
`classifier.dart` unchanged; the rest of the entries were added because the
Phase 2 spike hit them, and two of the plan's own entries turned out to be
wrong or incomplete for a current Flutter.

Each signature is marked `verified` or `catalog` in the source, so a reader can
tell which ones have been seen fail and which are taken on trust.

The notable additions:

| Signature | Why it is not in the plan |
|---|---|
| `Could not resolve package dependencies` + `Flutter/ephemeral` | The modern form of "fastlane archived a Flutter app". Since Flutter resolves through Swift Package Manager, this fails long before the plan's `exportArchive` message, which no longer appears. |
| `exportArchive No Team Found in Archive` | Only happens under the `gym` export shape, because a `--no-codesign` archive records an empty `Team`. |
| `Ambiguous choice. Please choose one of` | Not an error: gym prompting for a scheme, which makes a non-interactive run hang forever rather than fail. Costly precisely because nothing is reported. |
| `errSecInternalComponent` | A per-key keychain ACL. The message names nothing searchable, and it is what a developer hits the first time they build from a script rather than from Xcode. |
| `Could not find <gem> in locally installed gems` | A Homebrew fastlane displacing bundler's `GEM_HOME`. Reads like a corrupt bundle, so people reinstall gems instead of fixing the shim. |
| `version solving has failed` | Pins that are not mutually satisfiable on the running Ruby. `bundle install` does not degrade here; it installs nothing. |
| `Version Number: Missing` | Not a failure at all — `flutter build` exits zero. It is the only outward sign of the flavored-xcconfig defect, and App Store Connect rejects the resulting upload. |

That last one is why `taxiway build` classifies the output of *successful*
builds as well as failed ones. An exit code of zero is not evidence that the
artifact can be shipped.

## `bundle exec fastlane` is not sufficient on its own

The plan's rule — always `bundle exec fastlane`, never bare — is right and is
what the generated Gemfile says. It is also not enough.

Homebrew installs `fastlane` as a bash script that sets `GEM_HOME` and
`GEM_PATH` to its own directories and prepends its own Ruby to `PATH` before
exec'ing the real binary. It therefore discards everything bundler arranged, and
`bundle exec fastlane` runs a different fastlane against a different gem set.
The symptom is `Could not find <gem> in locally installed gems`, which looks
like a broken bundle rather than a hijacked one.

`doctor` now reads the `fastlane` on `PATH` and warns when it is a wrapper of
this shape, recommending a binstub — `bundle binstubs fastlane`, then
`./bin/fastlane` — which cannot be shadowed. Reproduced on this machine.

## No `Gymfile` is generated

The plan's artifact inventory lists one. taxiway does not write it.

Every gym option taxiway sets is either per-flavor — the scheme, the
provisioning-profile mapping — or load-bearing in a way that must be visible at
the call site: `skip_build_archive: true` is the single flag separating a
working export from the arrangement that fails, and `export_team_id` is what
stops a `--no-codesign` archive failing with `No Team Found in Archive`.

A `Gymfile` supplies defaults at lower precedence than the lane, so it cannot
break a correct lane. What it does do is give a reader a second place to look
before they can be sure what a build did, for settings that are all either
per-flavor or too important to be a default. Under `ios.export: flutter` gym is
not used at all, so a Gymfile would describe a tool the project never invokes.

## The `.ipa` filename follows `CFBundleName`, not the display name

Recorded because the first measurement was ambiguous and the wrong conclusion
was briefly written down. A real project exported `Lahent Dev.ipa` and set both
`CFBundleName` and `CFBundleDisplayName` from the same build setting, so it
could not distinguish them. A project where they differ settles it:
`CFBundleName = e2eapp` with `CFBundleDisplayName = E2E Staging` exports
`e2eapp.ipa`.

The consequence is sharper than the trivia. taxiway varies only
`CFBundleDisplayName` per flavor, so **every flavor of a taxiway project exports
to the same filename**, overwriting the previous one in `build/ios/ipa/`. A lane
that globbed and took any match would upload the last flavor built rather than
the one it just built. The generated lanes therefore accept only an `.ipa`
written after their own build began, and fail loudly when the export produced
nothing.
